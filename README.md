# 🏡 Predicting Rental Prices in Antalya  

## 📝 Project Overview  
This project aims to predict rental prices in **Antalya, Turkey**, based on apartment features such as size, location, and amenities. We built a **Machine Learning model** that helps users estimate rental costs before making a decision.  

## 📊 Key Insights  
- **Apartment size** (m²) and **neighborhood** are the most influential factors.  
- **Newer buildings** and **higher floors with elevators** tend to have higher rental prices.  
- **Fully furnished apartments** command a premium over unfurnished ones.  

## 🔧 Technologies Used  
✅ **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)  
✅ **Scikit-learn** (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM)  
✅ **Streamlit** (for user-friendly UI)  
✅ **AWS S3 / Digital Ocean Spaces** (for model hosting)  
✅ **Joblib** (to save and load models)  

## 🎯 Results  
- Developed a **rental price prediction model** with a **mean absolute error (MAE) of 106 USD**.  
- Integrated a **Streamlit-based web app**, allowing users to enter apartment details and receive instant price predictions.
